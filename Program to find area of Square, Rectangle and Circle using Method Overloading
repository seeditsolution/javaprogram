Java Program to find area of Geometric figures using method Overloading
BY CHAITANYA SINGH | FILED UNDER: JAVA EXAMPLES

This program finds the area of square, rectangle and circle using method overloading. In this program we have three methods with same name area(), which means we are overloading area() method. By having three different implementation of area method, we are calculating the area of square, rectangle and circle.

To understand this program you should have the knowledge of following Core Java topic:
Method Overloading in Java

Example: Program to find area of Square, Rectangle and Circle using Method Overloading
class JavaExample
{
    void calculateArea(float x)
    {
        System.out.println("Area of the square: "+x*x+" sq units");
    }
    void calculateArea(float x, float y)
    {
        System.out.println("Area of the rectangle: "+x*y+" sq units");
    }
    void calculateArea(double r)
    {
        double area = 3.14*r*r;
        System.out.println("Area of the circle: "+area+" sq units");
    }
    public static void main(String args[]){
        JavaExample obj = new JavaExample();
       
        /* This statement will call the first area() method
         * because we are passing only one argument with
         * the "f" suffix. f is used to denote the float numbers
         * 
         */
	 obj.calculateArea(6.1f);
	   
	 /* This will call the second method because we are passing 
	  * two arguments and only second method has two arguments
	  */
	 obj.calculateArea(10,22);
	   
	 /* This will call the second method because we have not suffixed
	  * the value with "f" when we do not suffix a float value with f 
	  * then it is considered as type double.
	  */
	 obj.calculateArea(6.1);
    }
}
